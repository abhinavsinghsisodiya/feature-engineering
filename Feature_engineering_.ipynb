        "-;Data encoding is the process of converting data from one format to another, often to make it more suitable for storage, transmission, or processing. It involves transforming information into a specific code or format, ensuring it can be read and interpreted by a computer or other system. This process is crucial for various applications, including ensuring data integrity, security, and compatibility between different systems."
